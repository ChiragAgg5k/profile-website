# Conditional Dependency Management Using Maven Profiles

Maven is an efficient build tool and project management tool mainly known for effectively building projects in Java. It is one of the most useful features in Maven, to effectively manage the consumers and producers of dependencies in a project.

In complex projects, you might need different dependencies or configurations based on various conditions such as the development environment, target platform, or specific build requirements. This is where Maven Profiles come into play.
Maven Profiles

Maven Profiles is a set of parameters that can be adapted to set or alter the default parameters of Maven build. They enable you to define the application construction process according to specific contexts like development, testing, or production.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Profile Activation:** Activations can be of several types depending on the option keys like command-line, Maven option settings, system environment variables, and system preferences.
- **Dependency Management:** It is possible to use profiles to specify which dependencies should be included and which ones should be excluded based on the currently active profile.
- **Build Customization:** With profiles, you can control how your build process is set up in aspects like plug-in settings, resources being filtered etc.

## Setting Up a Maven Project with Profiles

Let's walk through the process of setting up a Maven project that uses profiles for conditional dependency management.

### Step 1: Create a New Maven Project

First, let's create a new Maven project using the command line:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=profile-demo -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
```

**Output:**

This command will create a new Maven project with a basic structure. Here is what the output should look like:

Now, let's take a look at the directory structure that Maven has created for us:

### Step 2: Configure pom.xml

Now, let's modify the pom.xml file to include profiles. We'll create two profiles: development and production, each with its own set of dependencies.

```xml

    4.0.0

    com.example
    profile-demo
    1.0-SNAPSHOT

        1.8
        1.8

            junit
            junit
            4.13.2
            test

            development
            
                true

                    org.slf4j
                    slf4j-simple
                    1.7.32

            production

                    ch.qos.logback
                    logback-classic
                    1.2.6

```

In this configuration:

- We have a common dependency (JUnit) that's always included.
- The development profile includes the slf4j-simple logger.
- The production profile includes the logback-classic logger.
- The development profile is set as the default profile.

### Step 3: Create Java Classes

Let's create a simple Java class that uses the logger:

```java
package com.example;

public class App {
    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(App.class);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.info("Hello, Maven Profiles!");
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Build the Project

Now that we have set up our project with profiles, let's see how to use them.

#### Building with the Default Profile

To build the project with the default profile (development in our case), simply run:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

This will include the slf4j-simple logger in the build.

#### Building with a Specific Profile

To build the project with the production profile, use the -P flag:

```bash
mvn clean package -Pproduction
```

This will include the logback-classic logger in the build instead.

### Advanced Profile Usage

Profiles can be activated in various ways:

1. **Command Line:** As shown above, using `-P`.

For example, To activate the 'development' profile:

```bash
mvn clean package -Pdevelopment
```

2. **Maven Settings:** In the `settings.xml` file:

```xml

  production

```

3. **Environment Variable:** In the `pom.xml`:

```xml

    env
    prod

```

Then activate using: `mvn clean package -Denv=prod`

4. **OS Settings:** Activate based on the operating system:

```xml

    Windows 10
    Windows
    amd64
    10.0

```

#### Resource Filtering:

Profiles can also be used for resource filtering. For example:

```xml

    development

                src/main/resources
                true
                
                    application-dev.properties

```

This will only include the `application-dev.properties` file when the development profile is active.

### Conclusion

Maven Profiles provide a powerful way to manage conditional dependencies and configurations in your Java projects. By using profiles, you can easily switch between different build configurations for various environments or conditions. This flexibility allows for more maintainable and adaptable projects, especially when dealing with complex build requirements or multiple deployment scenarios.
