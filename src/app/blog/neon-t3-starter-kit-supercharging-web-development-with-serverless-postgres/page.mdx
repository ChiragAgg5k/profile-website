The Neon T3 Starter Kit is the ultimate open-source starter kit assembled around the T3 stack that uses Neon’s serverless Postgres database. This kit can easily be described as a game changer, offering developers a solid base from which they can build engaging, modern web applications with relative ease.

Our starter kit leverages the following technologies:

- Next.js framework for server-side rendering capabilities and a Full-stack environment.
- TypeScript for type-safe programming.
- Tailwind CSS for rapid frontend development/\.
- tRPC to provide end-to-end Typesafe APIs
- Prisma to provide ORM in database operations.
- Neon to provide a fully scalable and easy-to-set-up server-less Postgres database. (Not to mention completely free!)

> Note there were also other tools I used such as Shadcn, Magicpin, Lucide Icons, etc. A detailed list can be found on the GitHub Repository.

With this powerful combination, developers can dedicate more time to creating features instead of worrying about infrastructural issues.

You can find the Neon T3 Starter Kit on GitHub: https://github.com/ChiragAgg5k/neon-t3-starter-kit

This repository also contains a well-structured README that guides the user on how to use the said starter kit. We have also documented well how to set up the environment, configure Neon database, and deploy on sites like Vercel.

## My Journey

Selecting the T3 stack as a base for this Start kit was quite an obvious decision. The T3 stack created by Theo Browne is quite simple, type-safe, and is quite friendly to developers. In doing so, it serves as a reliable framework that allows for the development of scalable web applications.

Bringing Neon’s serverless Postgres into this stack was a fun task. I was glad to learn a lot about the server-less architecture of databases and how to make my applications faster and more scalable than before. Learning how to integrate Prisma with Neon’s Postgres instance was learning in itself because it demonstrated how other modern ORMs can easily integrate with modern databases.

Throughout this journey, I gained valuable insights into:

1. Using optimal database connections in a serverless environment
2. Utilising Neon’s branching for effective development workflows
3. Prisma and tRPC Type-Safe Database Operations
4. Challenges of maintaining both performance and developer experience in a full-stack application

Developing this starter kit has been a wonderful learning process. The developer’s tools have been improved through the collaboration of other developers to ensure that documentation is well-provided and easily accessible.

This Neon T3 Starter Kit should assist developers who are now facing issues with finding the right, maintainable, and enjoyable project stack!
